Nodes are colored based on the fold change of differential expression.
From FC -100 (dark blue) to FC 100 (dark red)

Borders of the nodes are colored based on significance.
From 0 (yellow) to 0.025 (greenish) to 0.05 (purple) for either praw or padj.

Edge thickness depends on the level of confidence in protein-protein interaction.

In padj networks: 
if nodes and borders are grey, it means these proteins were taken from the database as the closest ones to interact with DEGs

In praw networks:
PPI clusters in each netowrk were checked for functional enrichment using STRING Enrichment option in Cytoscape STRING app.
List of functionally enrichmed terms is in.csv tables for each cluster
